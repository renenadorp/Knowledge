# Services & Identities

### Providing identities to services <a href="#providing-identities-to-services" id="providing-identities-to-services"></a>

It's usually valuable for services to have identities. Often, and against best practices, credential information is embedded in configuration files. With no security around these configuration files, anyone with access to the systems or repositories can access these credentials and risk exposure.

Azure AD addresses this problem through two methods: service principals and managed identities for Azure services.

**Service principals**

To understand service principals, it's useful to first understand the words **identity** and **principal**, because of how they are used in the identity management world.

An **identity** is just a thing that can be authenticated. Obviously, this includes users with a user name and password, but it can also include applications or other servers, which might authenticate with secret keys or certificates. As a bonus definition, an **account** is data associated with an identity.

A **principal** is an identity acting with certain roles or claims. Usually, it is not useful to consider identity and principal separately, but think of using `sudo` on a Bash prompt in Linux or on Windows using "run as Administrator." In both those cases, you are still logged in as the same identity as before, but you've changed the role under which you are executing. Groups are often also considered principals because they can have rights assigned.

A **service principal** is an identity that is used by a service or application. And like other identities, it can be assigned roles.

**Managed identities for Azure services**

The creation of service principals can be a tedious process, and there are a lot of touch points that can make maintaining them difficult. Managed identities for Azure services are much easier and will do most of the work for you.

A managed identity can be instantly created for any Azure service that supports itâ€”and the list is constantly growing. When you create a managed identity for a service, you are creating an account on the Azure AD tenant. The Azure infrastructure will automatically take care of authenticating the service and managing the account. You can then use that account like any other Azure AD account, including securely letting the authenticated service access other Azure resources.
