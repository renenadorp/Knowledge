# Blueprints

**Azure Blueprint** allows you to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implement and adhere to your organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Blueprint enables development teams to rapidly build and deploy new environments with the knowledge that they're building within organizational compliance with a set of built-in components that speed up development and delivery.

**With Azure Blueprint, the relationship between the blueprint definition (what **_**should be**_** deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what **_**was**_** deployed) is preserved. This connection supports improved deployment tracking and auditing.**\

Azure Blueprint is a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts, such as:

* Role assignments
* Policy assignments
* Azure Resource Manager templates
* Resource groups

The process of implementing Azure Blueprint consists of the following high-level steps:

1. Create an Azure Blueprint
2. Assign the blueprint
3. Track the blueprint assignments
