# Governance & Compliance

Four sources for Governance & Compliance:

1. Microsoft Privacy Statement

4. Compliance Manager

## Trust Center

**Trust Center** is a website resource containing information and details about how Microsoft implements and supports security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in all Microsoft cloud products and services.

## Service Trust Portal

The **Service Trust Portal** (STP) hosts the Compliance Manager service, and is the Microsoft public site for publishing audit reports and other compliance-related information relevant to Microsoftâ€™s cloud services.

STP also includes information about how Microsoft online services can help your organization maintain and track compliance with standards, laws, and regulations, such as:

* ISO
* SOC

* FedRAMP
* GDPR

## Compliance Manager

**Compliance Manager** is a workflow-based risk assessment dashboard within the Trust Portal that enables you to track, assign, and verify your organization's regulatory compliance activities related to Microsoft professional services and Microsoft cloud services such as Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure.\
