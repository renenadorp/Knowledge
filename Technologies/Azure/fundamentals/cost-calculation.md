# Cost Calculation



* **Enterprise** - Enterprise customers sign an Enterprise Agreement with Azure that commits them to spend a negotiated amount on Azure services, which they typically pay annually. Enterprise customers also have access to customized Azure pricing.
* **Web direct** - Direct Web customers pay general public prices for Azure resources, and their monthly billing and payments occur through the Azure website.
* **Cloud Solution Provider** - Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) typically are Microsoft partner companies that a customer hires to build solutions on top of Azure. Payment and billing for Azure usage occur through the customer's CSP.

#### Usage meters <a href="#usage-meters" id="usage-meters"></a>

When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates one or more meter instances for that resource. The meters track the resources' usage, and generate a usage record that is used to calculate your bill. The meters and pricing vary per product and often have different pricing tiers based on the size or capacity of the resource.
