# Linear Regression

## Definition

Linear Regression is a technique to find a line in a two-dimensional space that best fits a given dataset, containing features and a label.&#x20;

The general form of this line is:

$$
ŷ = wX + b
$$

* ŷ = value to be predicted
* X = feature value (input)
* w = weight / slope
* b = bias / offset

The line defined by this function is also referred to as _decision boundary_

## Loss Functions for Linear Regression

Typically MSE (Mean Squared Error) is used as a cost function for linear regression.
